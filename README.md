# English Exercises

English teaching material, built for classroom, homework and one-to-one use.
Four independent pages live here — a game for young learners at the site
root, a bilingual business worksheet at `/business-clarity/`, an interactive
lesson for working adults at `/wealth-habits/`, and reading-aloud practice
built on a bilingual speech at `/campaign-speech/`.

## Word Play — CEFR A1, ages 7–10

Four activities across three vocabulary topics (Animals, Food, School),
following a **listen → read → spell → produce** progression:

| Activity | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| 👂 Listen and Click | Hearing a word and picking the picture |
| 👀 Read and Match | Reading a written word |
| 🔤 Missing Letter | Vowel spelling |
| 🧩 Build a Sentence | Word order and sentence frames |

### Design notes

- **Audio first.** Every prompt is spoken, and any picture can be tapped to
  hear it again. Seven-year-olds are still learning to read, so a text-only
  prompt would block them before the language does.
- **No failure states.** A wrong answer wobbles and invites another try; only
  a correct answer advances. The teacher panel still records first-try
  accuracy, so the useful signal survives without the child seeing a score
  drop.
- **No timers**, large touch targets (min 92px), and a layout that works on
  a phone as well as a classroom projector.

### Teacher panel

The faint 👩‍🏫 button in the top bar opens an overlay (not a new screen, so a
lesson in progress is not lost) showing first-try accuracy, words missed
repeatedly across games, a full answer log, and a voice picker.

Records are kept in the browser's `localStorage`, so they stay on the device
the child used and are never uploaded.

## Business Clarity — adult, one-to-one

A reading version of the *Business Clarity and Communication Worksheet*, the
40-page bilingual worksheet used in one-to-one business English coaching. It
covers thirteen sections, from explaining a business in thirty seconds through
pricing, cash flow and recruitment to a two-minute executive introduction.

### Design notes

- **English leads, Chinese supports.** Every line is a pair: English in a
  serif at full contrast, Traditional Chinese directly beneath in a smaller
  sans at lower contrast. Either language can be followed down the page
  without the other becoming noise.
- **Nothing is a form control.** Blanks, checkboxes and answer rules are
  drawn, not typed into — the client writes on paper or talks. Screen and
  print therefore look the same, and a stray refresh cannot lose a session.
- A contents sidebar tracks the section being read; on a phone it collapses
  into the top bar. **Print** puts each numbered section on its own page.

## Three Habits That Build Wealth — adult, teacher-led

An interactive lesson for working adults, built from the HBR CC Book Digest of
Scott Galloway's three highest-return habits. Five steps — advice versus
action, then one step per habit, then a step that puts the language to work —
carrying just over fifty collocations.

The article itself is not reproduced: each step has one short attributed quote,
a summary written for the lesson, and then the language work.

| Activity | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| 🗂 Phrase cards | Meaning and an example sentence, behind a tap |
| 🔗 Matching | Which half of a collocation goes with which |
| ✏️ Gap fill | Choosing the phrase that fits a new context |
| 🗣 Opinion poll | Taking a side and defending it |
| ⚓ Cabinet audit | Naming the people you go to before a decision |
| ⏱ Two minutes | Speaking to a prompt, ticking target phrases as they land |

### Design notes

- **English leads, Chinese waits.** Every line is a pair, but the Chinese is
  hidden behind a small 中 chip; the 中文 switch in the bar reveals the lot.
  Instructions, task prompts and the contents list stay bilingual — those are
  scaffolding, not comprehension practice.
- **Nothing is scored and nothing is saved.** A fresh load is a fresh lesson,
  which is what you want between two clients on the same laptop. Only the
  voice and Chinese settings persist. Wrong answers wobble, explain themselves
  and stay open — the exercise is a reason to talk, not a test.
- **🔊 everywhere.** Quotes, summaries, collocations, example sentences and
  sentence frames are all spoken by the browser, with the voice and speed set
  in the teacher panel.
- The faint 👩‍🏫 button opens the teacher panel over the lesson (not a new
  screen): show all Chinese, reveal every answer at once for going over an
  exercise together, pick a voice, or reset for the next student.
- **One photograph opens the lesson and each habit**, and no more. They are
  illustration, not content, so they carry no lesson text and are dropped from
  the print handout.
- **Print** gives a handout: everything behind a tap is opened, and anything
  that needs a mouse is dropped.

Photographs are from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/license/), whose licence
allows commercial use and requires no attribution; the photographers — Lara
Jameson, Polina Tankilevitch, Ron Lach and William Fortunato — are credited on
the page anyway. Each file is stored at 1600×900 and cropped by CSS, so
changing the framing is an `object-position` edit, not a re-export.

## A Five-Minute Campaign Speech — adult, reading aloud

Reading practice built on a bilingual speech: the candidate's own five-minute
address for the 52nd President of JCI The Port, 62 sentences long. The text
is reproduced as written — this page is practice, not an edit of his words.

The two jobs the page does are a switch in the top bar:

| Mode | What the learner does |
| --- | --- |
| 讀 Read | English leads. Read each line aloud, tap 🔊 to compare, 中 if the Chinese is needed |
| 記 Recall | Chinese leads. Say the English before tapping EN to check it |

### Design notes

- **The line is the unit.** Every sentence is its own numbered row, sized for
  reading aloud at arm's length rather than skimming, so "line 4" means
  something and nobody loses their place mid-paragraph. Seventeen lines worth
  memorising — the slogans and the one-sentence arguments — carry a gold rule.
- **Switching mode never rebuilds the page.** Both languages are always in the
  DOM and CSS decides which leads, so a switch mid-section keeps your place and
  costs nothing.
- **▶ Read this section** speaks a whole section one sentence at a time,
  highlighting each line and scrolling it to the middle, so the learner can
  shadow it. In 記 Recall it also opens each line as it reaches it, which turns
  the play-through into the answer key. A watchdog moves the run along if the
  browser never reports that a sentence finished — otherwise a machine with no
  audio output strands it on line one.
- **Words to watch.** Each section ends with the words most likely to trip up a
  Mandarin speaker, given as a plain respelling (`ri-spon-suh-BIL-uh-tee`)
  rather than IPA, because these are read off a shared screen mid-sentence.
- **A clock, because it is a five-minute speech.** ⏱ in the bar counts up and
  turns amber at five minutes. It is the only number on the page — nothing is
  scored.
- Headings, instructions and the contents list stay bilingual throughout; only
  the speech lines ever hide a language.
- **Print** gives a handout: both languages open, the machinery gone, line
  numbers kept for marking up.

## Layout

```
public/                   Word Play — the site root
public/business-clarity/  the business worksheet
public/wealth-habits/     the three-habits lesson
public/wealth-habits/img/ its four photographs
public/campaign-speech/   the speech reading practice
make-icon.py              regenerates public/apple-touch-icon.png
```

All four are plain HTML, CSS and JS with no build step.

## Editing the content

**Word Play.** Vocabulary and sentences live in
[`public/data.js`](public/data.js). Add a topic by copying an existing block;
each word needs a `word`, an `emoji` and an `article`.

The "Missing Letter" activity automatically skips words whose first vowel sits
in a digraph (*bread*, *book*, *paint*) — those have more than one defensible
answer.

**Business Clarity.** All the text lives in
[`public/business-clarity/content.js`](public/business-clarity/content.js), one
entry per section. Every string is an `en`/`zh` pair; keep the pair together
and the layout takes care of itself. Runs of underscores (`______`, or the
fullwidth `＿＿` in Chinese lines) become drawn blanks, so write them the
length they should appear. The block types — questions, checkboxes, phrase
lists, sentence frames, tables — are listed in a comment at the top of the
file.

**Three Habits.** The lesson lives in
[`public/wealth-habits/content.js`](public/wealth-habits/content.js), one entry
per step. Every string is an `en`/`zh` pair. The block types — quote, summary,
phrase cards, matching, gap fill, poll, cards, discussion, task — are listed in
a comment at the top of the file, and each is one function in
[`render.js`](public/wealth-habits/render.js).

A gap sentence marks its blank with `___` and gives the index of the right
option in `answer`; a phrase card wants an `eg` sentence, because that is what
gets read aloud. A `photo` on the lesson or on any step adds a picture — give
it a `src`, an `alt`, the photographer in `by`, and a `pos` if the default
centre crop cuts the wrong thing. To build a lesson from a different article,
replace the content file — nothing in the renderer knows about this one.

**Campaign Speech.** The speech lives in
[`public/campaign-speech/content.js`](public/campaign-speech/content.js), one
entry per section. Every string is an `en`/`zh` pair. There are only three
block types — `lines`, `subhead` and `say` — listed in a comment at the top of
the file, and each is one function in
[`render.js`](public/campaign-speech/render.js).

A line takes `k: 1` if it is worth memorising. A `say` item wants the word, a
respelling in `say`, and a short Chinese tip in `zh`. Line numbers restart at 1
in each section and come from the renderer, so inserting a sentence needs no
renumbering. Any other bilingual text works here unchanged — swap the content
file and the page is reading practice for that instead.

## Running it locally

No build step and no dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m http.server -d public 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> for Word Play,
<http://localhost:8000/business-clarity/> for the business worksheet,
<http://localhost:8000/wealth-habits/> for the three-habits lesson, or
<http://localhost:8000/campaign-speech/> for the speech.
